# Hangman

The application which I have created is a game of Hangman, with a twist. This is a game where the user must try to guess the hidden word using the letters in the alphabet (A-Z).
The twist in my game is that instead of vocabulary words, it is NBA themed and the user must guess the Team Name. If the user is successful in guessing every letter in the team 
name, meaning the entire name has been unveiled, the user will win. However, for every incorrect guess, a body part will be added to the Hangman Image (head, body, legs and then 
arms). Essentially the user will have a maximum of 6 incorrect guesses (letters not in the word) after which the user loses the game. 

This application, despite being a game enables the user to have fun and learn at the same time. This is because, as the user guesses letters correctly, its position in the team 
name will be revealed. This now becomes a puzzle, where the user must use problem-solving and critical thinking to guess other letters (think about common pairings of a letter).
